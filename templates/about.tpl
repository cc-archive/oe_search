<h2>About Open Education Search</h2>

<div class='aboutDiv'>
	Open Education Search is a tool for searching the entirety of the Internet
	for open educational resources (OER). OER are the efforts of a worldwide
	community, empowered by the Internet, to help equalize the access to
	knowledge and educational opportunities throughout the world. They are
	teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain
	or have been released under an intellectual-property license that permits
	their free use or customization by others. It is the granting of freedoms
	to share, reprint, translate, combine, or adapt that makes them
	educationally different from those that can merely be read online for free.
	Open Educational Resources include full courses, course materials, modules,
	lesson plans, textbooks, streaming videos, animations, tests, software, and
	any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to
	knowledge. Those who create them are contributing to a global commons – a
	realm where material can be used, reprinted, customized and recombined –
	without permission or fee.
</div>

<div class='aboutDiv'>
	This tool is designed to simplify the discovery of appropriate OER given
	their distribution in specialized repositories worldwide. There are a
	number of features included in this search tool (or are under development)
	that can further refine any search, such as by license type, educational
	level, media, etc. The search results will direct users to both stand-alone
	OER and those OER housed in more specialized repositories, where there may
	be additional tools for the discovery, contribution, and usage of OER.
</div>

<div class='aboutDiv'>
	This tool is itself an open resource, free for anyone to use in any way
	they see fit, including embedding it within other web sites or limiting the
	search to a specific subset of the search archive. We will be including
	additional information on these possibilities ASAP.

	<strong>Important</strong>: We are not currently limiting the definition of
	“open” for this search tool. As such, the materials you find here will be
	licensed with different degrees of permission to use the content. Read on
	for more information about this issue and some planned enhancements for the
	tool.

<ul>
	<li>
		The Open Education Search tool prioritizes OER by degree of openness, roughly in the following hierarchy (most to least open):
		<ul>
			<li>Public domain</li>
			<li>CC-BY</li>
			<li>CC-BY-SA</li>
			<li>CC-BY-NC</li>
			<li>CC-BY-NC-SA</li>
			<li>CC-BY-ND</li>
			<li>CC-BY-ND-NC</li>
			<li>Closed access (full &copy;)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The default &#8220;openness&#8221; hierarchy can be overruled using the advanced search page.</li>
	<li>
		Every attempt has been made to include all of the OER worldwide.
		However, there is currently no totally automated mechanism for
		identifying OER as such. If you know of OER that should occur further
		up the return-hierarchy, please send us the URLs and tags at:
		oesearch@creativecommons.org.
	</li>
	<li>We are working on a mechanism for users to contribute OER directly to the Open Education Search archive</li>
	<li>
		We are also constantly working to improve the quality of the search
		itself. One key to this process is user-contributions (via tagging) of
		the materials. Once the tagging feature is active, please contribute
		your insights and help us to more effectively sort and aggregate the
		world of OER!
